== 3.1.1 == 21/03/2013
 - Fixes to the build system, to make sure that builds of some modules
   are not tried if the libraries on the systems are too old. 

== 3.1.0 == 20/03/2013
 - Reworked the system of dealing with user polynomial, that is now
   a lot more flexible. 
 - Introduction of an initial Aberth floating point packet in the algorithm
   MPS_ALGORITHM_SECULAR_GA that gives performance boosts on easy polynomials. 
 - Reworked the regeneration of secular equations to be more performant.
 - Various consintency fixes
 - Introduced Jacobi-style iterations of Aberth, and allow the user to select
   the desired one at runtime
 - Small API changes to retrieve the results of a computation. 
 - Reworked improve routine that is more performant than the old one. 
 - Added a graphical debugger for the iterations. 
 - Added a graphical user interface for MPSolve, called xmpsolve. 
 - Added support for polynomials represented in the Chebyshev base. 
 - All the polynomial types (event secular equations) are now multithread, except
   the Chebyshev polynomials. 
 - Modified the Octave module to be compilable under more architectures. 
 - Reworked the headers to make MPSolve usable directly from C++.

== 3.0.1 == 19/02/2013
 - Fixed some bugs in unisolve that caused early exists
   without full approximation of some roots. 
 - Correction in the Octave module to ease compilation
   on all targets. 
 - Corrected a bug in the floating point shift
 - Slight optimizations on algorithm MPS_ALGORITHM_SECULAR_GA.
 - Corrections in the Matlab (TM) module. 

== 3.0.0 == 03/12/2012
 - First open source release of MPSolve
 - Implemented the secular solver as an alternative to the classical one
 - Support for solving secular equations
 - Parallelization of most of the parts of the algorithm
