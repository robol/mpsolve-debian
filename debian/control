Package: mpsolve
Architecture: any
Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}, libmps3 (= ${binary:Version})
Description: Multiprecision polynomial solver
 A polynomial rootfinder that can determine arbitrary precision approximations
 with guaranteed inclusion radii. 
 It supports exploiting of polynomial structures such as sparsisty and allows
 for polynomial implicitly defined or in some non standard basis. 
 .
 This package contains the command line version of MPSolve.

Package: libmps3

Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}
Description: Multiprecision polynomial solver
 A polynomial rootfinder that can determine arbitrary precision approximations
 with guaranteed inclusion radii.
 It supports exploiting of polynomial structures such as sparsisty and allows
 for polynomial implicitly defined or in some non standard basis.
 .
 This package contains the libmps shared library
